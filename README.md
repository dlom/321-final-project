Village Simulator
=================

Make sure you have a folder in this directory called `.env` that has the following variables filled out:

```
DB_USER=name
DB_PASSWORD=pass
DB_HOST=ip
DB_DATABASE=etc
```

This project has a few bugs/missing features that we'd like to add but probably never will.  Oh well.
